"""Bake a USGS 3DEP lidar tile into a NOCTIS-7 city texture.

The renderer consumes a 256x256 RGBA8 grid (height, palette|style, density,
flags). Procedural generation fills that grid from a seed; the source-city
parser fills it from text. This fills it from a laser survey, so the same
renderer walks a real place with no rendering code changed.

The points themselves are never shipped. What matters is the subtraction:

    DSM (highest return per cell) - DTM (ground surface) = height above ground

which is exactly the height field the renderer already eats. 4.7 billion points
collapse to a 256 KB texture.

    Class 9 is the documented answer and this survey barely populates it: over
    the East River it tags 4,204 cells of a body three times that size, because
    it can only tag cells that returned something. So water is measured the same
    way the vegetation detector measures foliage — off the beam.

    Three channels were measured against the cells this survey did tag, on
    Midtown at 4 m cells, and only one of them is worth anything:

        points/cell   water 15    other flat ground 46   weak: 70% recall
        intensity     water 69    other flat ground 43   real but *inverted*
        multi-return  water 0.00  other flat ground 0.00 nothing

    Near-infrared is absorbed by water, so the expectation was a dropout and
    darkness. Density does fall, but only threefold rather than to nothing, and
    intensity goes *up*: a flat surface returns specularly, so the few beams
    that do come back come back hard. Both predictions had the wrong magnitude
    and one had the wrong sign, which is why the rule below is not either of
    them.

    What actually identifies water is that its top surface is a plane. Over
    13,461 contiguous cells the East River's DSM spans 0.20 m. No land does
    that: the next candidate down, a pier at the same elevation, spans 1.34 m
    and returns points more densely than typical ground rather than less. So
    the rule is waterline plus flatness, with density kept only as corroboration
    — it is reported, not gated on, because on its own it recalls 70%.

    Flatness is judged on the DSM, which over water is the water surface itself.
    The interpolated ground surface cannot be used, because it never reaches the
    middle of a river at all (see the caller).
